# vrg
Dealing with arguments

This single header library provides two different functionalities:

   - Define functions with a variable number of argument in a simpler way than `stdarg.h`)
   - Deal with command line options and switches in a simpler way than `getopt()`)

Both *simpler* are, of course, IMHO!

See my article on [DEV.to](https://dev.to/rdentato/default-parameters-in-c-4kl1) for variadic functions
See the vrgtest.c for a rather complete example on command line options.
See the makefile for how to include it in your project 
See the source code for further documentation.

Feel free to contact me if you have any question/feedback/suggestion.
