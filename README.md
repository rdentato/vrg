Dealing with arguments

This single header library provides two different functionalities:

   - Define functions with a variable number of argument in a simpler way than `stdarg.h`)
   - Deal with command line options and switches in a simpler way than `getopt()`)

Both *simpler* are, of course, IMHO!

See the source code for documentation.
