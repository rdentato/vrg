Dealing with variadic arguments

This repo is home of two single header libraries 

  - `vrg.h` - for defining functions with a variable number of argument in a simpler way than `stdarg.h`
  - `cli.h` - for defining Command Line Interfaces (with commands and options)

To incorporate them in your project, use the headers in the `dist/` directory.
The fully commented code is in the `src/` directory.

The `demo/` directory containes examples that covers multiple use cases.
Programmer's manuals for both libriaries are in the `docs/` directory.
